# How Do I Contribute?

You can participate to this project and sub projects with any [issues](https://github.com/ewerk/querydsl-plugin/issues) 
and where [pull requests](https://github.com/ewerk/querydsl-plugin/pulls) are also welcome.

### Plugin Development

When contributing to plugin development, you should fork from the main project and create a new 
feature branch for your own commits. When you are done create a 
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to 
[upstream master](https://github.com/ewerk/gradle-plugins/tree/master).
If you are creating a PR from an issue, see [closing issues via commit messages](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).

 **Some guidelines**
* Plugins are developed for Java 1.8+ compatibility
* Please review the plugin for naming conventions and source code layout
* Java source code in this project is currently indented with 2 spaces
* Update any plugin `README.md` or `CHANGE_LOG.md` to reflect the latest values that may now be relevant after your changes
* Create a minimal JUnit test and possibly add an example to [gradle-plugins-samples](https://github.com/ewerk/gradle-plugins-samples)

**Development Setup**

From your plugin development branch, your latest changes can be installed to your local maven (`.m2`) 
repository with a version labeled at the `SNAPSHOT` build located in the `gradle.properties`.

To do this, use the `install` task
```
./gradlew build publishToMavenLocal
```

It is recommended to test any changes against the [gradle-plugins-samples](https://github.com/ewerk/gradle-plugins-samples)

### How do I setup a local plugin?

In your own project or, for example, in the samples build.gradle, remove [1] the line where the 
released version is applied from the Gradle plugin portal, add a `buildscript` [2] section 
using `mavenLocal()` as the repository and the plugin identifier to apply plugin.

Each plugin's `gradle.properties` maintains the current snapshot version.

**Example**

[1] Remove the current plugin portal version
```
plugins {
 // id 'com.ewerk.gradle.plugins.querydsl' version '5.0.0'
}
```
[2] Replace with a build script for your local snapshot version
```
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenLocal()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.ewerk.gradle.plugins:querydsl-plugin:5.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'com.ewerk.gradle.plugins.querydsl'
```
